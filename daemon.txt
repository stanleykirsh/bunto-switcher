Probably not a direct answer to the question, but systemd can be used to run your application as a daemon. Here is an example:

[Unit]
Description=Python daemon
After=syslog.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<run as user>
Group=<run as group group>
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python <python script home>/script.py

# Give the script some time to startup
TimeoutSec=300

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

I prefer this method because a lot of the work is done for you, and then your daemon script behaves similarly to the rest of your system.

    This is the proper and sane way. 1) Needs to be saved to /etc/systemd/system/control.service 2) managed sudo systemctl start control.service –
